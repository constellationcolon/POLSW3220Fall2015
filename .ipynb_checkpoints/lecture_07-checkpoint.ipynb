    "*   Short answer, MCQ, mini essay\n",

    "### (Weak) Pareto Condition (P)\n",
    "If everybody prefers x to y, then the group must choose x over y\n",

    "In the example, IIA can allow stuff like person A: xPy, person B: yPx => group outcome: xPy. No need for fairness, just consistency.\n",

    "## Arrovian Dictator\n",
    "Someone that always gets what they want, regardless of what other people want (in the example, just by trying to satisfy conditions U, P, and I).\n",
