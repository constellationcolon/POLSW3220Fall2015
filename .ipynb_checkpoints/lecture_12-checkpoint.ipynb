    "## Life After Arrow's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't have your cake and eat it too!\n",

    "## Transitivity, Quasi-Transitivity, Acyclicity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitivity\n",
    "Need to satisfy all of RR, PP, IP, PI, II\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quasi-Transitivity\n",
    "Need to satisfy PP only\n",
    "\n",
    "*   e.g. aIb, aIc\n",
    "    *   Transitivity: only bIc allowed\n",
    "    *   Quasi-Transitivity: bIc, bPc, cPb all allowed\n",

    "### Acyclicity\n",
    "Triple Acyclicity not enough. Must look for chains of every length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic\n",
    "*   Conditions of the form $p \\rightarrow q$\n",
    "    *   What happens when $p$ is false? $p \\rightarrow q$ automatically true.\n",
    "    *   e.g. if you don't have a chain that would violate T, then T is not violated.\n",

    "## Pareto Extension Rule\n",
    "Strictly choose an alternative ($xPy$) $\\iff$ somebody prefers that ($xP_iy$) and no one says otherwise ($\\not\\exists yP_ix$)\n",

    "$$xRy \\leftrightarrow \\neg( \\forall i, y R_i x \\cap \\exists_k yP_k x ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even satisfies strong versions of P (weak pareto condition) and D, P' (strong pareto condition) and D' (strong non-dictatorship condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strong Pareto Condition (P')\n",
    "If there are people who $xP_iy$ and the others $xIy$, then you have to choose $xPy$.\n",

    "## Strong Non-Dictatorship Condition (D')\n",
    "### Weak\n",
    "$$ \\not \\exists i: \\forall x, y, ~ xP_iy \\rightarrow xPy $$\n",

    "### 1. Sen (1969) Theorem\n",
    "Pareto Extension Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Gibberd's (1969) Theorem\n",
    "QT SDF with UPI $\\implies$ (Global) Oligarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oligarchy\n",
    "(improper) subset of people who have disporportionate power over all pairs of alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiable and unique group that together has dictator-like powers over all pairs of alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Only way to have an oligarchy and not violate anonymity, is to make everyone an oligarch\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every violation of anonymity creates an oligarchy. Could have just special powers over local pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impossible to have more than one oligarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Only way for entire group to be in oligarchy is the Pareto Extension Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Veto power\n",
    "Individual power\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\exists i \\in \\text{oligarchy}: \\forall x,y ~~ xP_iy) \\rightarrow (xRy \\equiv \\neg yPx)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Power to impose\n",
    "Collective power\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\forall i \\in \\text{oligarchy}: \\forall x,y xP_iy) \\rightarrow xPy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Pareto Extension Rule, everyone is an oligarch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Brown's (1975) Theorem\n",
    "If $N(\\text{alternatives} \\geq N(\\text{individuals}))$, SDF UPI $\\implies$ Collegium\n",
    "\n",
    "Just want acyclicity with UPI, still have to create a special group called collegium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want more group rationality $\\implies$ Need to concentrate group power\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decisive Coalition\n",
    "When unanimous in strict preference $xPy$, imposes at the group level that strict preference for $xPy$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\forall i \\in \\text{DC}, xP_iy) \\rightarrow xPy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Not special!\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire group is always a decisive coalition\n",
    "\n",
    "Any group of any size that can always get what it wants\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there people who can be in every possible decisive coalition?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Not under majority rule\n",
    "*   But sometimes yes!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collegium\n",
    "You are in the collegium if you are in every decisive collegium!\n",
    "\n",
    "Oligarchy $\\subset$ Collegium\n",
    "\n",
    "If there exists someone with veto powers, then that person is in the collegium. BUT you don't need veto powers to be in the collegium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time when a choice rule involves veto powers, there is a collegium. But there is no logical requirement that anyone in the collegium has veto powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e.g. UN Security Council\n",
    "To pass: need majority vote, no veto from security council\n",
    "\n",
    "Security council has no power to impose, but has veto powers\n",
    "\n",
    "Security council is in the collegium\n",
    "\n",
    "But don't need to have veto powers to be in the collegium. Just need to be in the intersection of all decisive coalitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e.g. No veto powers but in collegium\n",
    "Have veto powers over particular pairs only?"
