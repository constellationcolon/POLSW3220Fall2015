    "### 1. Universal Admissibility (U)\n",
    "-   Algorithm should work regardless of your preferences\n",
    "-   Preferences -> Blackbox -> Output\n",
    "-   Blackbox shouldn't explode just because you have a certain set of preferences\n",
    "-   Must take into account all cases (e.g. what happens if there's a tie?)\n",
    "-   Recall: \"Preference Profile\" is a set of individuals and their preferences\n",
    "-   Sometimes we want winner, sometimes we just want group ordering\n",
    "    -   Choice set vs. Maximal Set\n",
    "        -   Choice set X: $x \\in C(X) \\iff \\forall y,\\, xRy$\n",
    "            -   x must beat every other alternative\n",
    "            -   Only pairwise comparisons, so might be a problem\n",
    "            -   Must at least be weakly preferred over everything else\n",
    "            -   NOT the definition of Condorcet winner. Condorcet winner is winner in **majority vote**. Here we have pairwise comparisons, regardless of the group rule used.\n",
    "        -   Maximal set X: $x \\in M(X) \\iff \\not\\exists y, yPx$\n",
    "            -   There is nothing that strictly beats $x \\in X$\n",
    "    -   Can almost always use them interchangeably\n",
    "    -   If there is completeness, then choice set $\\equiv$ maximal set\n",

    "        -   neglecting transitivity\n",
    "        -   z is not the C(X) since there is no comparison between y and z\n",

    "### 2. Pareto Principle (P)\n",
    "-   If everyone agrees that x is better than y, then we should choose x over y\n",
    "-   $\\forall i,\\, xP_iy \\rightarrow xPy$\n",

    "### 3. Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives and Irrelevant Information(IIA)\n",
    "-   e.g.\n",
    "    - GNB 44%\n",
    "    - BGN 47%\n",
    "    - NGB 9%\n",
    "-   For any given pair of alternatives, who wins is not just determined by preferences of those 2, but also by the rankings of other alternatives\n",
    "-   Under IIA, the only preferences that are allowed to matter in the group ranking are the individual preferences for those 2 alternatives.\n",
    "-   Not meaningful to compare degree of preference. I don't want to know by how much you prefer x to y or y to x.\n",
    "-   Not meaningful to compare irrelevant alternatives z or m or j when you are just comparing x and y\n",
    "-   If there are 2 profiles, and if at the level of the x-y comparison the 2 profiles are identical, then IIA makes sure that the outcome is the same\n",
    "-   IIA violated if the 2 profiles are identical when comparing that specific pair and group choice is not the same\n",
    "-   If 2 profiles are the same on the pair level, then the group choice has to be the same in both.\n",
    "-   Depend only on the individual level of how the alternatives are ranked."
