    "December 8, 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "## Last Time\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single peaked preferences\n",
    "    * By majority vote, median voter's ideal point is group's (only stable) ideal point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "* individual win set\n",
    "    * set of points strictly preferred to any given point\n",
    "    * the only point with a null win set is your ideal point\n",
    "* group win set\n",
    "    * set of points such that a majority prefers them to any given point\n",
    "    * at median voter's ideal point, the win set is empty\n",
    "* core\n",
    "    * points at which win set is empty is called the core\n",
    "    * if there is no core, then there is no stable point under majority rule\n",
    "    * odd number of voters, core is a single point\n",
    "    * even number of voters, core is a closed interval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complications\n",
    "\n",
    "* majority rule may not be best\n",
    "* indifference\n",
    "* political parties; how institutions constrain/influence median\n",
    "* sophisticated voters\n",
    "* polarised voting\n",
    "* compromises on multiple issues at the same time\n",
    "    * you win some here, i win some there\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "* single peaked preferences are now 'mountains', based on distance\n",
    "![](20_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* take $(x_{\\text{median}},{y_{\\text{median}}})$? is this point in the core?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](20_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "draw circles centred at $A$, $B$, and $C$ that have the median point on the radius: these are equidistant points.\n",
    "\n",
    "any point in the intersection of two of these circles will be able to win over the median point by majority rule\n",
    "\n",
    "![](20_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "there still is overlap $\\implies$ no stable configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "![](20_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "when $A$, $B$, $C$ are co-linear, then $B$ is in the core and there is a stable point\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plott's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension of Black's median voter theorem to higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radial symmetry** Refer to `20_4.png`. $A$ and $C$ are a radially symmetric pair around $B$ because they are on the same line as $B$, _even though they are not the same distance from $B$_\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens to other voters? They also have to be radially symmetric around $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are odd voters, and one of the voter's position is such that the other voters are paired in radial symmetry, then central point is going to be the core.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](20_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Radial symmetry is incredibly hard to acheive for odd numbers of voters\n",
    "\n",
    "Even number of voters $\\implies$ a tiny bit easier to acheive radial symmetry. (e.g. remove $B$ from the group of voters, then the point where $B$ used to be will be in the core)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not very helpful in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when there isn't actually radial symmetry? (which is most of the time)\n",
    "\n",
    "## McKelvey's Chaos Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple dimensions, unless there is radial symmetry, or you get very very lucky with the voter distribution, then the core is going to be **empty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not stable point $\\implies$ cycling is going to occur!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an amendment agenda (via sincere, majority votes) from any point you name that will get you to to any other point in the entire space.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the points in the entire space are involved in a huge cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Institutional Constraints on the Agenda Setter\n",
    "\n",
    "* e.g. Congress drafting Bills\n",
    "    * where does this go? nowhere\n",
    "    * i.e. keep status quo\n",
    "    * not like an open amendment agenda\n",
    "    * always gets compared to the status quo\n",
    "    * $x_0$, the status quo, is always at the end of the amendment agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amendment agenda, sincere voters, end with status quo ($x_0$)\n",
    "    * can get any point in the intersection of any $\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$ voters, or the status quo\n",
    "    * $\\bar{x}_1$ type point: the set of points that can beat the status quo\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amendment agenda, sincere voters, begin with status quo\n",
    "    * get chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sophisticated Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amendment agenda, sophisticated voters, status quo at the end\n",
    "    * still can get $\\bar{x}_1$ points because they sincerely prefer those points to the status quo\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amendment agenda, sophisticated voters, status quo at the start?\n",
    "    * Next time!"
