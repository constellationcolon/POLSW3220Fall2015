    "## The Seven Dwarves Problem\n",
    "*   Method of Majority Rule\n",
    "    *   Guarantees completeness but not transitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use an Agenda?\n",
    "    *   Doesn't remove the problem, just obscures it\n",
    "    *   Algorithmic\n",
    "    *   Do not make all possible comparisons\n",
    "    *   Observations\n",
    "        *   Doc was the winner in the agenda, but not particularly popular amongst the three people\n",
    "        *   Very volatile; one comparison enough to knock you out\n",
    "        *   The later you are in the agenda, the better chances you have of winning, since you need to fight less people in order to be the overall winner\n",
    "        *   There are **4** dwarves that can beat Doc by majority vote!\n",

    "## Cycling\n",
    "*   How often does cycling occur? When? How? Probabilistically?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Definitions\n",
    "    *   Preference Profile\n",
    "        *   A fixed group of people and their preferences\n",
    "    *   Condorcet winner\n",
    "        *   An alternative that can beat each and every other alternative in a pairwise vote\n",
    "        *   Cannot be a cycle for the top choice, but _still can have a cycle over the rest of the positions_\n",
    "    *   Condorcet loser\n",
    "        *   An alternative that will lose to each and every other alternative in a pairwise vote\n",
    "    *   Voting cycle\n",
    "        *   When by majority vote, there is loop of alternatives where the first beats the second, the second beats the third, etc., and the last beats the first\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Consider 3 people and 3 alternatives\n",
    "    *   Each person has 13 possible preferences\n",
    "    *   216 distinct profiles\n",
    "        *   12 without a Condorcet winner\n",
    "        *   204 there is a Condorcet winner\n",
    "    *   Cycles are probabilistically not that common\n",
    "    *   BUT if voting many times, and have many alternatives, cycles more likely\n",
    "    *   3 voters, 3 alternatives: 6%\n",
    "    *   5 voters, 5 alternatives: ~20%\n",
    "    *   Approach to infinity: 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Hard to see cycles in the real world\n",
    "    *   Often doesn't exist a well defined rank of preferences\n",
    "    *   There might be dropoff to a 1v1, one from each party\n",
    "    *   Preferences based on who is still running\n",
    "    *   **We have a specific voting agenda in stuff like the presidential vote**\n",
    "        *   This agenda prevents us from seeing the raw preferences of people\n",
    "        *   Heavily censored by institutions and strategic choice\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If there is a voting agenda and a Condorcet winner, the voting agenda will find the Condorcet winner for you\n",
    "    *   Not the case that anything that wins a voting agenda is the Condorcet winner\n",
    "    *   Condorcet loser can never win a voting agenda\n",
    "        *   A voting agenda is guaranteed to knock out any Condorcet loser\n",
    "    *   If you're first on the agenda and still win the agenda, you're a Condorcet winner\n",
